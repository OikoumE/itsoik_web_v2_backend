## Features:

-   It sucks!
-   its only by luck that it works!
-   Replace tags in HTML by using EXACTLY this syntax:
    -   for CSS: <br>
        (requires opening and closing `<style>` tags)<br>
        `<style>{% style <nameOfFile>.css %}</style>`
    -   for scripts(js): <br>
        (requires opening and closing `<script>` tags)<br>
        `<script>{% script <nameOfFile>.js %}</script>`
    -   for including another HTML: <br>
        `{% INCLUDES <nameOfFile>.html %}`
    -   for extending another HTML <br>(supports BLOCK (must have matching block in file it extends)) <br>
        `{% EXTENDS <nameOfFile>.html %}`<br>
        `{% BLOCK <nameOfBlock> %} {% ENDBLOCK <nameOfBlock> %}`
